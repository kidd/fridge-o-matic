* fridge-o-mattic

** Parts:
   - arduino uno
   - 2 leds
   - buzzer?
   - lcd screen
   - a fridge
   - MAGNETS! (of course, the secret sauce)
** open door
** countdown

** Development
   I finally got to develop inside emacs. arduino-mode, and adding
   your use into dialup group should do it.


   - 00..10 => beep immediately.
   - 10..... => set chrono at (cm-10) minutes.

   The problem is to store the flags so that a chrono is not set while
   running a countdown, or set again when it finishes at wtv distance the
   marker is.

   A lot of flags int the code that show I don't know what I'm
   doing. This looks like it should be an FSM, because that's what
   those things are. Or use Ferret.
